There are inconsistent line endings in the 'Assets/Wwise/Deployment/API/Handwritten/Common/Timeline/AkTimelineRtpcTrack.cs' script. Some are Mac OS X (UNIX) and some are Windows.
This might lead to incorrect line numbers in stacktraces and compiler errors. Many text editors can fix this using Convert Line Endings menu commands.

There are inconsistent line endings in the 'Assets/Wwise/Editor/WwiseComponents/AkRTPCPlayableInspector.cs' script. Some are Mac OS X (UNIX) and some are Windows.
This might lead to incorrect line numbers in stacktraces and compiler errors. Many text editors can fix this using Convert Line Endings menu commands.
